## General Admission Requirements
Admission to TUM is competitive, with requirements varying based on the level of study (undergraduate or graduate) and the specific program. However, certain general requirements apply to all applicants:
1. **Academic Excellence**: TUM seeks students with strong academic backgrounds. For most programs, applicants should be in the top 30% of their graduating class.

International students applying to undergraduate programs at TUM must meet several key requirements:
6. **University Entrance Qualification:** International applicants must possess a secondary school leaving certificate that is recognized as equivalent to the German “Abitur.” The specific requirements vary by country of origin.
7. **Qualification Assessment:** TUM evaluates international qualifications through a process called “Hochschulzugangsberechtigung” (HZB) assessment. The university uses a database called “anabin” to determine the equivalence of foreign qualifications.
8. **Preliminary Courses (Studienkolleg):** If an applicant’s qualification is not deemed fully equivalent to the Abitur, they may need to complete a preliminary course at a Studienkolleg and pass the assessment examination (Feststellungsprüfung).
9. **Subject-Specific Requirements:** Some programs require specific subjects to have been studied at the secondary level, with minimum grade requirements.
10. **German Language Proficiency:** Most undergraduate programs are taught in German, requiring proof of German language proficiency (typically TestDaF or DSH).
### Technical University of Munich Requirements for IB (International Baccalaureate) Students
For IB students, the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.successcribe.com/technical-university-of-munich-tum-qs-ranking-acceptance-rate/) admission requirements specify that Math, a science subject, and one language must be taken at Higher Level, with a minimum of 4 points in each subject. Students with an International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma must meet the following criteria:
#### **Specific IB requirements include:**
1. **IB Diploma Score:** A minimum total score of 24 points is required for consideration, though competitive programs typically expect scores of 32-36 or higher.
2. **Subject Requirements:**
	- At least three Higher Level (HL) subjects relevant to the program of application
	- Mathematics at an appropriate level (Mathematics: Analysis and Approaches HL is recommended for most STEM programs)
	- For engineering and science programs, relevant science subjects at HL
3. **Grade Requirements:** Minimum grades of 5 in relevant HL subjects, with an average of 6 for competitive programs.
4. **Additional Points:** The points awarded for the Extended Essay and Theory of Knowledge can be important for meeting the minimum total score requirement.

### Technical University of Munich SAT Requirements
While the SAT is not a mandatory requirement for admission to TUM, students from countries with 12-year school systems (like the US or international curricula) may use SAT/ACT scores to demonstrate academic readiness.
1. **SAT Score Requirements:** TUM typically requires a minimum SAT score of 1300 (out of 1600) for most programs, though competitive programs may expect scores of 1400 or higher.
2. **SAT Subject Tests:** For technical and scientific programs, SAT Subject Tests in mathematics (Level 2) and a relevant science subject (Physics, Chemistry, or Biology) are often expected, with scores of 650 or above. No longer accepted post-2021.
3. **SAT as a Complement:** The SAT is used as a complement to the US High School Diploma. A strong SAT score can strengthen an application but does not replace the need for a solid academic record.
4. **Alternative Tests:** TUM also accepts ACT scores as an alternative to the SAT. A composite score of 28 or higher is generally expected.
5. **Score Reporting:** Official SAT scores should be sent directly to TUM using the institution code 7368.
Although Technical University of Munich SAT requirements aren’t strictly mandatory, strong scores can enhance your application. 

| **Program**                  | **Minimum SAT Score (Evidence-Based Reading & Writing + Math)** | **Minimum ACT Composite Score** |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Engineering & Sciences       | 1200+                                                           | 24+                             |
| Management & Social Sciences | 1100+                                                           | 22+                             |
It’s important to note that while SAT scores are considered, they are just one component of the application. TUM takes a holistic approach to admission decisions, considering the entire academic profile.
